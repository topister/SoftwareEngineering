## What is Frontend Development?

Frontend development involves designing and building the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) of a web application. It’s everything users can see, touch, and interact with in their browser.

### Think of a website as a house:

HTML: The foundation and structure.

CSS: The paint, furniture, and decor that make it beautiful.

JavaScript: The electricity and plumbing that make it functional and interactive.
