## What is Frontend Development?

Frontend development involves designing and building the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) of a web application. It’s everything users can see, touch, and interact with in their browser.

### Think of a website as a house:

HTML: The foundation and structure.

CSS: The paint, furniture, and decor that make it beautiful.

JavaScript: The electricity and plumbing that make it functional and interactive.

### Frontend vs. Backend Development

#### Frontend (Client-Side):

Focuses on how things look and feel to users.
Runs in the browser or your mobile-device.
Core technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

#### Backend (Server-Side):

Handles logic, database interactions, and server-side processes.
Runs on a server.
Technologies you’ve used: Python, Flask.

#### How They Work Together:

The frontend sends requests (e.g., "Get this user’s profile data") to the backend.
The backend processes the request and sends a response back to the frontend.
Example: When you click a “Submit” button, the frontend collects data and the backend stores it in a database.

#### Frontend Technologies

Technology | Role | Example Use

HTML | Structure of the webpage | Adding headings, paragraphs, images.

CSS | Styling and layout | Changing colors, fonts, layouts.

JavaScript | Interactivity | Animations, dropdowns, API calls.
